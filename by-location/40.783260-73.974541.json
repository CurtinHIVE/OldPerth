The twelve story structure seen at the aforementioned corner became the Hotel Colonial and bore No. 443-449 Columbus Avenue. (Also, No. 51 West 81st Street later). Empty lots and private residences intervene between this and No. 17-15 West 81st Street (right margin) which in 1905 housed the American Geographical Society. This view remained the same in 1922 with one exception: the two four-story residences on either side of the vacant 25 ft. lot were razed and upon this site were erected a twelve-story apartment house, No. 39-35 West 81st Street.\nDecember 1905.\n\nGeorge L.
