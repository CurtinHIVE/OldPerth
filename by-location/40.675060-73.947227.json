Sperr.\n\nThese buildings were on the south side of St. Marks Avenue, in the center of the block between New York and Brooklyn\nAvenues.  They were across the street from 789 St. Marks Avenue, the building that I grew up in (still standing).  These three houses were torn down, apparently in the early 70s, and replaced by a nursing home.  If the story is true, the easternmost mansion was built for Abraham Abraham (no typo) one of the founders of A&S.\n\nJoseph B. Raskin\njbraskin@hotmail.com\n\n",
