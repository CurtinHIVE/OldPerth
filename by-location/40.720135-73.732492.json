The original building, known as the Union Hall Academy for boys, was erected in 1792 and used as such until 1820 when a new building for the academy was erected on the west side of Union Hall Street, just north of the Long Island Railroad tracks.  The original building became a female Seminary under the trustees of the Union Hall Academy and was destroyed by fire on Febhruary 12, 1841.  The cornerstone of the building in this view was laid on March 11, 1843 and the seminary was reopened in May of that year and was still used as such in 1876.  This structure was subsequently owned by ex-sheriff Welliam Cass Baker who had it remodeled in 1897 when it became known as Colonial Hall.  It was then used as a public hall and club rooms, subsequently becoming a family hotel and rooming house.
