The photographers vantage point is the small childrens play area that is being built at this point as a portion of the new East River Drive. The Municipal Bath House is to his left and is not included. In the background is the vague outline of the new block square annex to the Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. Bldg.\n\nJuly 18, 1939.\nP. L.
