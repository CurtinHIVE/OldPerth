His son Samuel conducted it until he died 1767. Abraham Rapelye operated it during the Revolutionary War. At this time it was also the headquarters of the Loyalists. After the war it was called the Union Hotel. On May 3, 1817 it was purchased by the town for the Presbyterian Parsonage for the Rev. Wm. Boardman and used as such until 1822 when the 3rd parsonage was erected. Rev. Boardman died 1818 and was succeeded by the Rev. John Goldsmith D.D. The house was sold in 1822 and was used first as a store and then for many years as a residence. It stood vacant for years and was finally taken down. This site was originally occupied by the house of Ralph Hunt. Peter Duryea\nwas the owner in 1852.\nNugene L. Armbruster Collectionn\n",
