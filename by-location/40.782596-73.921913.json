Long Island City (a part of greater New York) is on the right of the picture, with Ward's Island on the left. The structure turns, crosses the island, passes over water again to Randall's Island and finally reaches the mainland in the Borough of the Bronx. It is wholly a railroad bridge, part of a six mile road connecting the Pennsylvania and New Haven Systems and permitting through freight and passenger service between New England and the South.

It makes the fifth bridge across the East River all except the Brooklyn Bridge have been opened in the last twelve years.\n\nApril, 1917\nAmerican Press Assn.\n",
