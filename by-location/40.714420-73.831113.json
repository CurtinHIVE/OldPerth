This farm, comprised of 77 acres, was used as a stock farm. On it was a one-half mile circular trotting course. This Jackson, maintained a general store just west of L. Younger's house which was on the N.W. corner of Vleigh Place and Union Turnpike. No buildings appear on any of the Queens Atlases after 1909 and the only buildings that appear on that year are near the northern boundary of the property, just south of Edgar H. Meeker's property. Cord Meyer became the owner of this property after 1891. For a number of years he operated a pumping station. This is a set of four views taken on different days and from different angles. It is probable that if these buildings were standing in 1937 they would be between 132nd and 138th Street. However they were demolished sometime in 1929.\n\nOctober 1928.\nViews 1, 2 & 3.\nView 4: April 1929.\n\nEugene L. Armbruster Collection.",
