This house was reputed to date from 1780; others, however, claim it was built much earlier in the century.  It was demolished in 1910. The property was owned by C. Stevens, but in 1722 Jan Lucasse and Johanus Voorhees sold it to one Hogelands; Rem Hegeman bought it of a Van Dyke in 1795 and another Van Dyke bought it of H. Hogelands in 1825. This property was in the Van Wyck family and heirs until 1916.\n1908.\nEugene L. Armbruster Collection.\n",
