The structure shown is the second, as the first (cornerstone laid in 1775) was destroyed by fire prior to completion. It was immediately rebuilt and nearly complete when the Revolution began. The unfinished building was occupied by the British and Hessian soldiers as a barrack and hospital, and it was not until January, 1791, that it was in a proper condition to receive patients.\n\nPrior to 1869\n\nGift of Urbrook Collection",
