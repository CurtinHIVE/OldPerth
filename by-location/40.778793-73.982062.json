The Hotel St. Andrew will stand in 1936, but the church will give way between 1920 and 1925 to a five-story building. About 1895. Brown Brothers.\n\nAccording to the New York Times of October 3, 1937, the Hotel built in 1893, will be replaced by a 4 or 5-story business structure. This site was the result (to himself and at a total cost of only $6,500) of a shrewd land speculation deal, by Robert Robertson in January 1886. It became the property of Morris Schinasi, the cigarette manufacturer at a later date and whose heirs are involved in the present transfer.\n",
