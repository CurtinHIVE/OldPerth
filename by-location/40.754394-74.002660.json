Note the cobblestone condition of this thoroughfare which, popularly was called \"railroad\" or \"death\" Avenue; the latter because of the dangers involved in the juxtaposition of railroad, horse and foot traffic. In 1938 this feature was eliminated as then the railroad cut was opened to direct this freightage from the open street. Photographs of same will be found under individual locations and the West Side Improvement Project.\nAbout 1905.\nInternational News",
